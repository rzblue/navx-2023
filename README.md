[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/rzblue/navx-frc)](https://github.com/rzblue/navx-frc/releases/latest)

This is an *unofficial* repository containing source for the NavX FRC libraries updated for 2023 WPILib.

Use this url to install the vendordep online:

This was originally an effort to publish a version for the 2023 beta period, but is now a community maintained fork, and the source has diverged somewhat.

Notes:

- Support for VMXpi has been removed as I do not have the source for the native library.

This repository is published under the license specified by the Maven Repository listing and by the downloaded source, which can be found at [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)
